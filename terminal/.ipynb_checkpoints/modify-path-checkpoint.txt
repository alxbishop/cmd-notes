To modify path variable that have been added from installed packages
run in terminal

pwd to verify our working dir
ls -la will display all hidden folder and files

check for .bash_profile
check for .zshrc

I read that now we only need to modify .zshrc and not .bash_profile
so run

sudo nano ./.zshrc

modify the text by removing the unwanted portion then ^O should save otherwise ^X to exit and it will ask to save and name for file
